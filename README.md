# Tink JNI Examples
*Sample codes of using [Tink](https://github.com/google/tink) with non-Java languages*

## Introduction
[Tink](https://github.com/google/tink) library is currently available in Java, C++ and Obj-C. The purpose of the sample code is to allow developers to use [Tink](https://github.com/google/tink) in other languages. 

The core implementation of [Tink](https://github.com/google/tink) is in Java. Thus, the sample codes use [Java Native Interface (JNI)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/) to create API bridge allowing Java code to be called by native applications written in other languages.
